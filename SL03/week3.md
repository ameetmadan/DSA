# Divide and conquer

Divide and conquer has 3 central steps

- Divide into subproblems
- Concquer subproblems with recursive solution
- Combine solution of subproblems into solution for the original problem.

##Â Merge sort

- Divide: divide the sequence into two $n/2$-element sequences
- Conquer: sort the two sequences recursively using merge sort
- Combine: merge the two sorted sequences to produce the solution
