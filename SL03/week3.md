# Divide and conquer

Divide and conquer has 3 central steps

- Divide into subproblems
- Concquer subproblems with recursive solution
- Combine solution of subproblems into solution for the original problem.

## Merge sort

- Divide: divide the sequence into two $n/2$-element sequences
- Conquer: sort the two sequences recursively using merge sort
- Combine: merge the two sorted sequences to produce the solution

# Reccurences

The running times of algorithms with recursive calls can be described using recurrences. There exist 4 basic ways how we can get to the reuccurence formula:

- Repeated (backward) substitution: Expand the recurrence by substitution and then notice the pattern
- Substitution method: Guess a bound and then use induction to prove that the guess is correct
- Recursion trees: Convert a recurrence in a tree whose nodes represent the costs
- Master method: Templates for different classes of recurrences
