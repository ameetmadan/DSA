## What is a binary tree?

![](08_04_2021_20.12.png){ width=350px }

```C
A = [2, 7, 5, 2, 6, 9, -, -, 5, 11, 4]
```


We start at the root of the tree (2), and then display the left (7) and right (5) child of the root. Each node is not allowed to have more than one parent. The only node, which has no parent, is the root. A leaf is an element (here 2, 5, 11, 4) which has no children.

The depth of a binary tree is the level where an element sits. The root is level 0. The height of the binary tree is determined what the longest path of a node to a leaf is. The root is level 1.
