a) This algorithm is a sorting algorithm, as can be seen in the last steps of the outer loop. There are three input values, A[] is an array with n elements and there is the value k, which is an integer. Firstly, we define the variable sum, which will be used later in swapping the variables. We then set the variable maxi equal to the iteration variable i and continue into our second for loop. Here we set j = i+1, indicating that j is always greater than i. If A[j] > A[maxi] we then set maxi = j, making j the highest integer in the array. Back in our first for loop, we set sum (which is still equal to 0) + the maximal variable, which indicates that A[j] is the highest in the array. With the swap variable we then swap A[i] with A[maxi]. My understanding of this algorithm is that we have a given array as well as an integer which is not in the array. What we then do is check where this integer should be placed in our array.
