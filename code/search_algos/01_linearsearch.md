## Explaination
Linear Search is the most basic type of searching algorithm. It sequentially moves through your collection (or data structure) looking for a matching value. In other words, it looks down a list, one item at a time, without jumping.

## Strengths and weaknesses

| Strengths                        | Weaknesses                              |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Good for small lists             | Not in list at all, or the last element |
| Does not need to an ordered list | Slow in processing elements             |

## Optimized usage

It can be of good use for unordered lists of short length. 

## Asymptotic complexity

$O(n)$ because we have to check each element from starting to end
