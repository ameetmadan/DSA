# Data Science and Algorithms
My coursework for the "Informatics II" (Data Structures and Algorithms) course at University of ZÃ¼rich

- Introduction, basic sorting, recursion (chap 1 in CLRS)
- Complexity and correctness (chap 2, 3 in CLRS)
- Divide and conquer, recurrences (chap 4 in CLRS)
- Heap sort, quick sort (chap 6, 7 in CLRS)
- Pointers, lists, sets, abstract data types (chap 10 in CLRS)
- Trees, red-black trees (chap 12, 13 in CLRS)
- Hash tables (chap 11 in CLRS)
- Dynamic programming (chap 15 in CLRS)
- Graph algorithms (chap 22, 23, 24 in CLRS)
